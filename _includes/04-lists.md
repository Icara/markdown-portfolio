### The following are what I'd personally call: the only emojis you should be allowed to use!
1. **weary** - :weary:
* This is an important emoji
* No questions should be asked
2. **flushed** - :flushed:
* This emoji is very anime
3. **cowboy** - :cowboy:
* Y'all ever been to yee-haw land?
* Let's head to Texas bois
* Yipee-kiyay yee haw partner
4. **rage** - :rage:
* This is important for someone disrespectfully pings you on discord
* @everyone
5. **thinking** - :thinking:
* For if there's no cowboy emoji
* This is what I look when I wonder why an uncultured lacks the holy cowboy emoji
